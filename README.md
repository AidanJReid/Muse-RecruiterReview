# Recruiter Review

A 'Glassdoor-esque' website and portal to allow job seekers to:
* Rate various recruiters and/or companies (via their HR experience) about their recruitment process
* Share their experience (bad and good). This, in turn, will help raise the standards of the recruitment industry by shining a light on poor practice and demonstating those who do get it right.
* Connect with selective employers/recruiters who complement the interest and skills of the candidate

## UX

Quite a bit of work needed to make this idea a reality - much of which is beyond my current skillset (Aug '19, including including a data set.

Aiming to use Bootstrap for fundamental structure.

Site will serve both jobseekers and also those in the recruitment industry.

Wireframe to follow in due course.

### Collaboration

* Buy-in on the idea from my colleague, IT recruiter Chris J.
* Shoehorn Data Scientist Sean M in somewhere!
